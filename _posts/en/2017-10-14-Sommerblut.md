The client needed a new implementation based on an existing design of an event platform featuring artists from the annual Sommerblut culture festival.
For this project, all pages needed to be accessible / barrier-free. Additionally SEO for the festival and modularity was the focus.
I realized this coding a custom WordPress theme using an event plugin showing data on a number of different templates. The client is able to freely edit and rearrange the pages using custom coded modular content blocks via ACF.
