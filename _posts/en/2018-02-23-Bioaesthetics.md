A Woocommerce based multi-language webshop for nutrient and dietary supplements.
For this project, I set up a design using a premium theme. During the development process, I developed custom functionality and styles fitting the client's exact needs.
Long term I had the responsibility to make the e-Commerce process as smooth as possible, implement payment methods like PayPal One Touch and Swipe or connect the MailChimp newsletter.
